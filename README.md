# Public Art Finder

## Description
So.. what is a 'Public Art Finder' anyway?

The app as it's name implies provides a way for a local community to find and identify public art within their area. An area in this case usually refers to a metropolitan city. It is an app maintained by Code for America, originally built by 2011 Fellow John Mertens (@mertonium) while working with the city of Philadelphia. It has now been [deployed in other cities](http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/public-art-finder-mapper-mobile).

A running instance of the app can be seen at http://phl.publicartapp.mobi/

It looks like this:
